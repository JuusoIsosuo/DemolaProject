This was a school project carried out in collaboration with the Finnish innovation platform Demola. The purpose of the project was to develop a solution that calculates the most environmentally sustainable transportation options for deliveries and determines the optimal routes to minimize emissions.

We did it in a group of 7:
- Ensar Kunduraci
- Jani Sarja
- Juuso Isosuo
- Jaan Barlow
- Roope Kallinen
